## Setting up the API Key

To get started, follow these steps to set up your API key:

For Android: 

1. Create a file named `key.properties` in the **android** folder of your project.

2. Open the `key.properties` file and add your Yandex MapKit API key like this:

   ```properties
   MAPS_API_KEY=yandex_mapkit_mobile_sdk_key

For iOS:

1. Create a file named `keys.plist` in the **ios** folder of your project.

2. Open the `keys.plist` file and add your Yandex MapKit API key like this:

   ```keys
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
   <dict>
	   <key>MAPS_API_KEY</key>
	   <string>YOUR_API_KEY</string>
   </dict>
   </plist>

For Flutter:
3. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.

2. Open the `.env` file and add your API keys like this:

   ```env
   ORG_SEARCH_API_KEY=yandex_javascript_api_and_geocoder_http_api_key
   YANDEX_GEOCODER_API_KEY=yandex_places_http_api_key
